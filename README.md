Chatbot
This is our repository to checkin code for anything related to our hackathon for Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances (DARPG). This is a online Hackathon on Data-driven Innovation for Citizen Grievance Redressal

Getting Started
We have a sample Gemini AI(Google's AI) code to test its working. 

This code can then be modified to ceate a interactive chatbot which is Ministry Specific to help the Citizens to resolve their common queries related to filing a Grievance in the CPGRAMS portal (https://pgportal.gov.in) and expedite smooth submission of grievances.

Prerequisites

1. Generte your API Key : 
        I have explained the process on my blog : https://medium.com/@mani.bellan/introduction-to-gemini-ai-fe16b1bbedfe

2. Update the key in the config.yaml file

3. Create a python virtual environment and post it is activated, install the libraries using the command 
        pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Once the libraries are installed, test the code by running it on the terminal
